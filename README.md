# Bloggit
A Personal Project to design a layout for a user interface of a social media platform.

## Idea
Bloggit is a social media platform where users can upload their daily blog posts. Users can also follow a series of other users, which will then present the user with their blog posts on a timeline. The need for this type of application comes from the lack of blogging sites that act like social platforms. Most bloggers will have a dedicated website, which requires users to navigate different user interfaces. This can add a layer of complexity that may turn users away from the blogging community entirely.

## Similar Sites
Facebook is designed to share most formats of social media and has a plethora of functionality. You can play games, vist marketplaces, message friends, and view posts (which includes user create stories, profile picture updates etc). Facebook folllows a bubble like design, utilizing cards that have a vertical flow. Each card is roughly the size of the page, ensuring there is enough space to see the top of the following card and bottom of the previous card to suggest to the user that they can scroll. Facebook utilizes a blue and white pattern. The limited colors and fonts create an environment that is easy for the user to remember. This is helpful for the user as they navigate through different pages of facebook, as the consistency in the design allows the user to know where they are at all times. The header for the page contains the facebook logo, and navigational buttons. This is the part of the page the users will notice first (humans are trained to read top to bottom, left to right). As such, Facebook follows this intuition, leading the user from the more important components of the site first.
Redit is a lot like facebook in the form of social media. You can post a plethora of different media types. However, Reddit removes some functionality that facebook offers, and cuts down to a simplier design. Cards are utilized to seperate different items like Facebook. We see the same design pattern shared with instagram as well. 

## The Box Model
The Box Model is a simple design and layout model, where all object are considered a box (either with their bounding box, or some alternate justification). When designing with HTML elements, each element can be considered as it's own box. However, we alter the HTML element's box visually with CSS. The CSS box model wraps around every HTML element, consisting of (outer layer inward) a Margin, Border, Padding, and then finally, the HTML element itself, the content. Each box can generally be one of two types, Block or Inline. A Block box will ensure it is not in the same row as some other object (the default behaviour of HTML elements) and will also attempt to fill 100% of it's allocated space (unless some width or height has been defined). Inline boxes will behave almost opposite to the Block boxes. Firstly, they do not break onto a new row, and also, they do not attempt to fill the space or respect width and height properties.

In this project, we will be utilizing both types of boxes defined in the Box Model. This will allow the website to develop into a more freely placed design (with a sidebar) whilst also retaining regidity in it's structure. We can see similar designs with Reddit.

## Design Decisions
When creating Bloggit (found out later that this is already the name of a site, will change later on if need be), the design is loosely based around what is commonly sense with most social media sites.

#### Header
  The header contains a searchbar and login page. These are the most important components of the page, as they hold most of the functionality. By placing these items at the top of the page, the user does not need to search around for long before finding a means to login or search for their favourite blogger. Without any JS implementation, currently the functionality is not avalible, however, if the user was logged in and wanting to view their own page, the login button would be replaced with an icon representing the user. This could come in the form of a metaphore (like the outline of a human) or this icon could be the users profile picture. 

#### Content
When looking at the page, the content on the left (underneath the header) takes up most of the remaining page. The placement and size of this content area is for two main reasons. The first is that humans are trained to read top to bottom, right to left. If the functionality of the website is at the top, this is the first thing the user will notice. The second will be this content area. Inside of this content area we find posts from accounts the user is following, dating from the most recent to the least. This content is the reason the user is on the site, and thus needs to play a larger role in attracting the users attention. This is also why the size of the content area trumps the size of the sidebar area. It holds more importance. What you will also notice is that the area is highlighted in one large divider. The reason for this, is to suggest that the content is all of the same type. The searchbar does the opposite (more on that below). By encompassing each post with it's own card, and then placing all those cards in the same divider, the user should establish that all those card maintain different content, but are all of the same type of content. 

#### Sidebar
The sidebar is located on the right, and is the smallest of the two components on the screen. This is due to the fact that it is not a "key" component of the webpage. The idea, and functionality of the webpage would remain the same without the sidebar, however, it is provided as additional content to help the user navigate the site, and present the user with some topics they might find interesting. Each sidebar suggestion is it's own card. This is so the user will know that each suggestion is not of the same type. With the content area, these are all blog posts that the user has subscribed to, however, the suggestions panel are individual suggestions to the user, based on their preferences. Thus, making them of different items. The user should be able to know this by their seperation. 

#### Color
The color theme picked for this site is design in such a way that the user can read it for long periods of time. The background color is a low grey, whist the component colors are a shade of purple, and the text boxes are white (such that the user can lower their screen brightness, without losing the primary content on display).
